# Cartoonify-images-using-machine-learning

Cartoonization is itself a classic art but, the evolution in the field of Machine Learning is covering almost every realm. In this project I have used Computer Vision and Machine Learning to cartoonify any image using python.

## Process of converting an image to a cartoon

To convert an image to a cartoon, multiple transformations are done.
1. Convert the image to a Grayscale image. Yes, similar to the old dayâ€™s pictures.!
2. The Grayscale image is smoothened
3. Extract the edges in the image
4. Form a colour image and mask it with edges.

This creates a beautiful cartoon image with edges and lightened colour of the original image.
